        Hello, there. Friday Night Funkin'-ers. Good day today, huh. A good ol'
        Tuesday.
      </p>

      <p>Hope you guys enjoy the tacos too! ;)</p>

      <p>
        I, like many people on these sort of Tuesdays, tend to eat a little
        overdose of tacos.
      </p>

      <p>It's just the right thing to do on Tuesdays.</p>

      <p>
        Anyways, this week's newsletter will talk about the adarWeb project and
        what it has to do with its predecessor, VS. Adar: Entity Encounter.
      </p>

      <p>
        adarWeb is made specifically for the VS. Adar Mod to store information
        about the mod, keep track of credited individuals that worked on the
        mod, and to give status updates.
      </p>

      <p>
        It will also be used as a download page at some point and time (if we
        can get it to work).
      </p>

      <p>
        VS. Adar, right now, is being worked on at the moment, just not as much
        now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Were probably going to spend time worrying about this webpage before we
        get into the mod fully.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyways here's something I (Canonic) made as a shitpost. I think its
        kinda funny.

      Your browser does not support the video tag.

      care :>
