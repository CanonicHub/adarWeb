   <p15>-</p15> Hello, there. Friday Night Funkin'-ers. Good day today, huh. A good ol' Tuesday.
</p2>

<br>
<br>
<br>


<p2>
    Hope you guys enjoy the tacos too! ;)
</p2>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p2>
    I, like many people on these sort of Tuesdays, tend to eat a little overdose of tacos.
</p2>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p2>
    It's just the right thing to do on Tuesdays.
</p2>

<p2>
    Anyways, this week's newsletter will talk about the adarWeb project and what it has to do with its predecessor, VS. Adar: Entity Encounter. 
</p2>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p2>
    adarWeb is made specifically for the VS. Adar Mod to store information about the mod, keep track of credited individuals that worked on the mod, and to give status updates.

</p2>

<br>
<br>
<br>


<p2>
    It will also be used as a download page at some point and time (if we can get it to work).
    
</p2>

<br>
<br>
<br>


<p2>
    VS. Adar, right now, is being worked on at the moment, just not as much now.
</p2>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p2>
    Were probably going to spend time worrying about this webpage before we get into the mod fully.
</p2>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p2> Anyways here's something I (Canonic) made as a shitpost. I think its kinda funny.</p2>

<p2> Thats it for this week's short, but sweet (and first) Newsletter. Take care :></p2>
